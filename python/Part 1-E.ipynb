    "Let's begin by establishing the fact that we can't possibly learn everything about git here, but we will cover the most important aspects involved in working with a team using remote git repositories to share and maintain code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start from the assumption that you have a working SSH keypair for authenticating with Github. If not, then please make sure you find relevant instructions for doing so (installing your public SSH key using your account) before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so first, let's think a little about what a repository **is** and why it is useful. First, you need a place to maintain code where anyone can download and use it: this is what a git repository is to most people. Second, you need to be able to modify or make updates to your code and then upload them to the repository so that users can make use of your updates. Finally, you need to be able to understand how git helps you ensure that the integrity of the code is maintained even though **multiple** people are working on the code in the repository at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by pulling a repository down, making some changes and pushing them back into the repo. We are assuming a simple one-person development model at this point, and will move to multiple edits later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will work from a local directory called `git-tutorial` within my home directory. From there I will start investigating a git repository and make some changes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's pull down the `git-sandbox` repo from the website, and start looking around...\n",

    "You can see that the repo contains two files: LICENSE and README.md which are the only \"code\" in the repository so far. However, it also contains a hidden directory, `.git`, which contains special files that help git understand that this directory contains a git repository. You should normally leave these files alone. In particular, if you remove the `.git` directory, then git will no longer be able to understand that this is a git repository, and you will no longer be able to use it as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to keep in mind about these repositories is that they are **complete** copies of the code **and** all code history. This means that each clone of the repo contains all changes made to the repository going all the way back to its initial creation. This would lead to a lot of bloat in size, but git usually just stores the *differences* between files (lines added and lines deleted) from your code (in a compressed form) to keep the repo a reasonable size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, this had implications for your file management: **large data files** should normally **not** be stored in the repo. It would be better to keep those in a public web location, and have them be downloaded using the tools and scripts in the repo when needed. That being said, smaller files for project testing and debugging may be kept in the repo without adding too much bloat to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we now have a **complete** clone of the repo, it can be used completely *offline*. Any changes made can stored and managed using git's management tools, and can later be added to the remote repository when we go back *online*.\n",

This will be **rejected** since we made the earlier merge (and pushed the correspnding commit) since this user tried to do this. There is no way for git to automatically merge the conflicting files, so it requires you to perform a pull **first** and manage the merge before this user can complete the push.

A typical model for working on a project where we want the master branch to stay pretty stable and only rarely updated is instead to have separate branch for code development (we will just call ours **development**). This other branch will be created from the master branch by choosing a commit from which to start (we can just let it be the current commit in our repository).\n",

    "You can do this at any time, but it might be a good time to *make our new branch right now*, since we currently have a conflict but we would still prefer to push our version to the repository so that others might benefit or use it. So, making a new branch would allow us to do this..."

Upstream changes are the kind where someone else makes a change before you do. So, others who have write access to the same repository will also be able to have access to this branch and potentially put you in the same position as we were already in with master! This requires team coordination, where team members are aware of who is working from certain branches.\n",

    "In fact, you may want to go so far as to make only **one person** responsible for updating master, just to make sure that it doesn't get updated too often. You may then want to have a development branch to which everyone may push, but **communicate** before such changes are made. Then, each team member might maintain a personal branch (made based off of development) which only that team member will directly work on/from. It's possible to merge changes between such branches when needed, and this can be coordinated as needed. However, I still even make a new **local** branch based off of my personal branch before I perform any merges with it, just to ensure that nothing gets lost in a complicated merge. OK, this are mostly just suggestions/warnings for now (and are not necessarily even best practices) but there are even better ways to do this. This would be enough to get the ideas flowing, but we will see an example of a more safe way to merge changes than this model in the future.\n",
